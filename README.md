The rapid growth of AI-driven startups has led to an explosion in venture capital investment. However, this growth is accompanied by increasing risks of fraud, exaggerated claims, and poor corporate governance â€” as seen in high-profile failures like Theranos, FTX, and WeWork. Traditional investment decision models rely heavily on subjective judgment, financial projections, and market trends, but they often lack systematic mechanisms to detect early signs of deception, opacity, or misalignment between hype and product maturity.

There is a critical need for transparent, interpretable, and ethically grounded decision-support systems that go beyond predicting growth to assessing truthfulness, governance, and sustainability.

This research proposes **Krezomon**, a novel hybrid framework that combines rule-based expert logic with adaptive machine learning to evaluate startup investment opportunities while actively detecting fraud and governance risks.
